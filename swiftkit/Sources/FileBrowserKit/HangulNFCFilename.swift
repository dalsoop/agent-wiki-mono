/// Filesystem-level helper for renaming a single file from NFD to NFC
/// form on disk. Shared by the right-click "Normalize Filename to NFC"
/// action (`FolderBrowserViewModel.normalizeFilenamesToNFC`), the
/// drag-out auto-normaliser (the `appKitFileDrag` / `inactiveDragSource`
/// modifiers, gated by the `normalizeHangulOnDragOut` setting), and the
/// copy/move/duplicate normalise-on-write path in `FileOperationService`,
/// so every path uses the same correct implementation.
///
/// Why this exists instead of a one-liner around `FileManager.moveItem`:
///
/// 1. `URL(fileURLWithPath: nfcString)` and
///    `URL.appendingPathComponent(nfcString)` silently re-normalise
///    the path component to NFD on construction. The "NFC URL" you
///    think you handed to `moveItem(at:to:)` actually carries NFD
///    bytes by the time the underlying system call fires.
/// 2. APFS is normalisation-insensitive, so a rename from an NFD name
///    to a Foundation-renormalised NFD name reads as "rename to same
///    name" and is a silent no-op — the file's on-disk bytes stay
///    unchanged, even though `moveItem` reports success.
///
/// POSIX `rename(2)` takes raw C strings, so passing the NFC UTF-8
/// bytes directly forces APFS to rewrite the inode's name. The URL
/// returned to the caller is rebuilt via
/// `URL(string: "file://…<percent-encoded NFC>…")` because
/// `URL(fileURLWithPath:)` would re-NFD it on the way back into the
/// drag pasteboard — verified empirically, not from docs.
