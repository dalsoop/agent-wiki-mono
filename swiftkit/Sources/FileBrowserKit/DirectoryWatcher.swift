/// 200 ms debounce so a recursive `cp -R` of a hundred files only
/// triggers one reload.
///
/// FSEvents' kernel-level notifications are basically free in steady
/// state — the watcher only does meaningful work when something
/// actually changes — so we keep one watcher per open tab and let
/// per-tab `reload()` calls fan out independently.
///
/// The wrapper is `@unchecked Sendable` because the C-callback hands
/// us a raw `info` pointer with no Swift isolation context; we hop
/// back to `DispatchQueue.main` before invoking `onChange`, so the
/// caller's closure always runs on the main queue.
